# Casefile: Bank vs GL Reconciliation

This kit simulates a small client engagement:
- you receive a bank export (`left_bank.csv`)
- you receive a GL export (`right_gl.csv`)
- your job is to produce a deterministic reconciliation pack

Book 2 uses this style of kit to demonstrate handoffs and replay-safe workflows.
